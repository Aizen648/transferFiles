# transferFiles
The program detects changes in the folder in real-time and then sorts the files.

The program creates 4 folders - HOME, DEV, TEST, and BIN, if they did not exist before.  
The program detects new files in the HOME folder and sorts them into the appropriate folder.   
The program checks the contents of the remaining folders and saves the result in a count.txt file in the HOME folder.
